<h2>Who is Sindile?</h2>

 <p1>Sindile Makhathini is a girl from Malibu Village with a dream that will become her reality.
   That dream is to become a fully fledged software developer. 
   She fully understand that, that is something that will take time but she is fully prepared 
   to put in the work to make her dream a reality.</p1><br><br><br>  

   <p3> Her motto is why not do it all. The reason she started to become interested in software 
     development is because she wants to be an investigative journalist who has her own website 
    and network. She believes that she needs to equip herself with all the knowledge that she will need.
    Yes, it all seems farfetched, ludicrous and a little bit crazy, but wasn't the woman who created the 
    lightbulb crazy too? </p3><br><br><br>
